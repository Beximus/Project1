			<h3>ABOUT:</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="flex-item blurb">
			<p>Trails Wellington is an app with an online/offline accessible database of the mountain bike and walking trails in wellington. Alongside maps and trail routes, it will contain a layer of trail metadata curated by the community. Users will be able to log information such as: difficulty, accessibility and primary traffic. Points of interest can be marked. These will include rest stops, lookouts, and utilities such as drinking water, toilets and maintenance posts.</p>

			<h3>Welly Walks App</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="flex-item comCons">
			<p>Content is more like a brochure advertising some of the walks available in wellington. There are no maps available and information about each route has to be downloaded individually.</p>

			<h3>Trailforks App</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="flex-item comCons">
			<p>Requires a log in to use, has global coverage and maps are downloaded for offline use, however maps and information are for mountain-biking only and there is no information about shared traffic.</p>

			<h3>Accessibility & Use</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="flex-item comCons">
			<p>The First picture is from the start of a Track in the Prince of wales park in central wellington. It is pretty clearly very accesible and is part of a popular pedestrian route between Brooklyn and town. The Second picture was taken a 5 minute walk from the first, just after the first fork. This part of the trail is no longer accessible to wheelchairs or strollers and has a fairly even split between bike and foot traffic.</p>

			<h3>Features & Hazards</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="flex-item comCons">
			<p>Some sections of the trails in the Prince of Wales park (and greater Wellington in general) are lit by streetlights and these are features that would be highlighted by the Trails Wellington app. The second image shows a section of track that is perfectly fine to walk on a dry day however, when it has been raining it becomes more difficult to navigate.</p>
